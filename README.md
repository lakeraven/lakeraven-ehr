# lakeraven-ehr

SMART-on-FHIR Rails engine for VistA / RPMS-backed EHRs.

## Status

Pre-1.0 — scaffold landed, feature ports in progress. Each feature
arrives as a self-contained PR backed by a Cucumber BDD scenario set
(see `docs/features.md` for the roadmap).

## What this engine is

A mountable Rails 8.1 engine that provides the data and identity
layer for an EHR running on top of an RPMS / VistA backend:

- **FHIR R4 reads** for `Patient` and `Practitioner`, US Core profile
- **SMART on FHIR** authentication and EHR launch
- **PHI audit logging** with ONC G10 / Inferno compliance in mind
- **Multi-tenant** by tenant + facility (row-based, fail-loud)
- **Adapter-driven** — clinical reads delegate to a configurable
  adapter; the reference implementation calls
  [`rpms-rpc`](https://github.com/lakeraven/rpms-rpc) directly

## What this engine is NOT

- **Not a case-management system.** Case workflows live in
  [`corvid`](https://github.com/lakeraven/corvid), a sibling engine.
  Neither depends on the other; a host application wires them
  together at the application boundary.
- **Not a PHI store.** The engine ships zero PHI at rest. Patient
  identifiers are stored as opaque tokens; clinical data flows
  through the adapter at request time and is presented as FHIR
  resources without persistence.
- **Not a billing or claims engine.** Billing, claims, and other
  third-party integrations live outside this engine in the host
  application that mounts it.

## Architecture

```
lakeraven-ehr  ←—— sibling ——→  corvid  (case management, optional)
    ↓ uses
rpms-rpc      (pure Ruby wire layer for VistA/RPMS)
```

A host application mounts `lakeraven-ehr`, optionally also mounts
`corvid`, and wires `Lakeraven::Case.adapter` to call into
`lakeraven-ehr` services so corvid can stay EHR-agnostic.

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "lakeraven-ehr"
```

Then `bundle install`. Mount the engine in your host app's routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Lakeraven::EHR::Engine => "/ehr"
```

Requires Ruby 3.4+ and Rails 8.1+.

## Development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rails app:db:create app:db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
bundle exec rake test
```

Working against an unpushed sibling checkout of `rpms-rpc`:

```bash
bundle config local.rpms-rpc ../rpms-rpc
```

## Contributing

Each feature PR ports one BDD feature set from the legacy `rpms_redux`
codebase. The Cucumber scenarios are the spec; new code makes them
pass without rewriting the assertions.

See `docs/features.md` for the port roadmap and ADRs in `docs/adr/`
for the architectural decisions that shape the engine.
